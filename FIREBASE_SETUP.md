  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",

    // Teachers collection - readable by all, writable by admins
    match /teachers/{teacherId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if false; // Only admins can modify teachers
    }
    
    // Reviews collection - readable by all, writable by authenticated users
    match /reviews/{reviewId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow update, delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
    }
    
    // Users collection - readable/writable by the user themselves
    match /users/{userId} {
